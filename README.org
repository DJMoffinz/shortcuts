#+title: Shortcuts
** Description
Shortcuts (or sc for short) is a small utility I've written in bash to give me shortcuts to commands I use a lot.

** Fuctionality
Currently the script's only function is to supply a simplified syntax for downloading youtube videos from yt-dlp. i'll write up a detailed description of what it does in here sometime but for now just read the code. its pretty clear and there are some comments.

** Usage
copy the script to ~/.local/bin and make it executable
add that directory to your path
add an alias for the script
and you're done

unless there are people out there who use the command line exactly like i do, i don't imagine many people will find this repo useful. just putting my work out there lol.

** Credits
i used a great tutorial on some random website to set up the argument parsing in this script. i can't find it in my browsing history, but if i do i'll link it.
